      "Hello! My coding journey began in my freshman year at the University of Waterloo, where I built a Minesweeper game as a course project. I was fascinated by how something I created could interact with me and amazed by the endless possibilities of what I could build next. That experience sparked my passion for computer science.",
      "The field of computer science is incredibly broad. Throughout my studies, I’ve taken internships across various domains to explore its full spectrum, including database systems, embedded systems, machine learning, and software development. As I’ve gained experience, I discovered that my true passion lies in building machine learning models that solve real-world problems and turning those solutions into usable software products.",
      "When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me watching or playing soccer, hiking local trails, watching movies, or trying out new recipes in the kitchen. I believe that diverse experiences outside of tech help me grow into a more creative developer and a stronger teammate.",
      "I’m always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate with others who share a passion for creating impactful digital experiences."
